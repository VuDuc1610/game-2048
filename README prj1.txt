Description:

	Method:
		- print: make the frame for the board and print out it in the console (line 14 to 50).
		- addNum: check if the array2D empty or not, then add number to random position in array2D (line 53 to 76)
		- canMove: to indicate if you can still make any of the valid move or not (line 79 to 99)
		
		- moveNumRight, moveNumLeft, moveNumDown, moveNumUp: method to move the elements inside the array2D just like 2048 (line 103 to 224)
		- startGame: starting the game by adding the first 2 numbers randomly to the array2D (line 228 to 292)
		- maxNum: returning the maximum number in the array2D (line 295 to 305).
		- clearConsole: clear the console each time print out (line 308 to 313).
	

	Main method (line 314+): I already included all of the comments in the code in order to keep track (including creating array2D, pressing 's','a','w','d','q','r', when you win, and when the game is over)
